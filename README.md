# Features [![CI - Test Features](https://github.com/edouard-lopez/devcontainer-features/actions/workflows/test.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/edouard-lopez/devcontainer-features/actions/workflows/test.yaml)

> Some devcontainer features I find useful.

* [bats](src/bats/README.md): Install `bats` (Bash Automated Testing System)
* [x] prettier
* [ ] httpie

## Usage

In your IDE, add the features to your `devcontainer.json` (e.g. [VSCode][vscode]). Each feature has a `README.md` that details options.

```json
{
    "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/base:ubuntu",
    "features": {
      "bats": {}
    }
}
```
